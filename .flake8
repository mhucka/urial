# Summary: Project-wide Flake8 configuration.           -*- mode: conf-toml -*-
#
# Note: as of version 4.0, flake8 does NOT read global configuration files
# from ~/.flake8 or ~/.config/flake8.  If you had such a config file of your
# own, and you're looking at this config file and wondering how the two will
# interaction, the answer is simple: they won't.  Only this file matters.
#
# The following flake8 plugins are assumed to be installed:
#   flake8-bugbear
#   flake8-builtins
#   flake8-comprehensions
#   flake8-executable
#   flake8-implicit-str-concat
#   flake8-pie
#   flake8_simplify

per-file-ignores =
    # The @plac line in __main__.py is more readable if you align the equals
    # signs, which runs counter to E251 ("unexpected spaces around
    # keyword/parameter equals"). It would be better to disable E251 just for
    # that block in the file, BUT flake8 only recognizes per-line annotations,
    # so there's no way to tell it to ignore a rule only for a block of code.
